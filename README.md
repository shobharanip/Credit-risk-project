# Credit-risk-project
This project is related with a loan and challenge is to predict approval status of loan (Approved/ Reject).  Credit risk analysis and credit risk management is important to provide loans to businesses and individuals. Credit risk can occur for various reasons such as bank mortgages (or home loans), motor vehicle purchase finances, credit card purchases, installment purchases, and so on. Credit loans and finances have risk of being defaulted. To understand risk levels of credit users,  we will (and credit providers) normally collect vast amount of information on borrowers. Some predictive analytic techniques can be used to analyze or to determine risk levels involved on credits, finances, and loans, i.e., default risk levels. We are trying to find default probability of Cumulative Accuracy Profile (CAP), the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic.
